    <h2>Distinguished Advisors</h2>
    <i>The Rust Foundation executive staff consults with several unpaid advisors outside of the Rust Project who have been selected for their policy-focused knowledge of the Rust community, open source software organizations, and the nonprofit sector. The neutral perspectives of these “Distinguished Advisors” help us consider many different angles when making decisions that fall under their areas of expertise. </i>
