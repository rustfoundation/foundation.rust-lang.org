The Rust Foundation is excited to announce a recent $100K USD donation from [LambdaClass](https://lambdaclass.com/) (“Lambda”) — a deep tech venture studio and investment firm with expertise in a variety of industries, including gaming, machine learning, cryptography, database design, distributed systems, programming languages, compiler development, high-frequency trading, real-time bidding, embedded devices, aerospace, and biotech.

This donation was made by Lambda to “support the ongoing development and maintenance of the Rust programming language” – our core mission as the nonprofit steward of the Rust programming language and community.

In a statement of intent about their donation, Lambda said the following:

LambdaClass is dedicated to advancing the technological frontier by applying cutting-edge technologies to generate and disseminate scientific knowledge with practical applications. Rust has been an integral part of our work since 2014, delivering great results, and we believe our contribution will further strengthen the language's impact on the global tech community.

We are committed to making a positive difference and look forward to seeing the outcomes of this sponsorship.

We appreciate the opportunity to support the Rust Foundation and are excited about the positive change this donation will bring.

LambdaClass Founder, Federico Carrone, said the following about the donation:

*"Supporting the Rust Foundation and the Rust language has been crucial for us, reflecting our commitment to building safe, performant, and concurrent systems. This initiative also demonstrates that LambdaClass and the Latin American tech community can give back to the tools and communities that have helped us excel in the industry."*
