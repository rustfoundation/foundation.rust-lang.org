This year, the Rust Foundation is excited to host <a href="https://rustconf.com/" rel="nofollow">RustConf</a> for the first time in Montreal, Canada, and online from September 10-13, 2024. Just a few weeks remain!

## What to Expect

RustConf 2024 will feature talks covering various topics within open source and Rust.

Some key themes include:

* **Security:** Rust‚Äôs role in enhancing security, including making open source secure by design, memory-safety across foreign function boundaries, and ‚ÄúX-safety‚Äù in unsafe environments.
* **Performance and Optimization:** Rust‚Äôs compiler performance, low-overhead observability, and profile-guided optimization.
* **Rust in New and Exciting Places:** Rust‚Äôs growing impact in industries like game development, robotics, space missions, and 3D design.

We are also looking forward to a handful of sessions about the Rust community‚Äôs growth and collaboration, Rust‚Äôs integration with other languages, and the future roadmap of the language. There are a total of four exciting keynote talks, which you can learn more about here: <a href="https://rustconf.com/programs/#keynotes" rel="nofollow">https://rustconf.com/programs/#keynotes</a>

### Workshops

For those joining in person, there are three optional hands-on workshops on September 10th before the official start of the conference.

**Workshop 1: Run Your Rust Code on Embedded and On the Web**

*Instructor: Carl Kadie*

This workshop will teach you how to run Rust code on web browsers and embedded devices using WebAssembly and ‚Äúno\_std‚Äù environments. The focus will be on adapting Rust applications to different platforms and reintegrating essential library features for consistent functionality.

**Workshop 2: Real World Testing in Rust**

*Instructor: Jorge Ortiz Fuentes*

This workshop is for anyone seeking practical experience testing realistic applications. Participants will use a REST API implemented with Axum to write meaningful tests using standard tools and crates, making them suitable for real-world unit testing scenarios.

**Workshop 3: Unleash Your Computer‚Äôs Power with Rust - Safely**

*Instructor: Herbert Wolverson*

The workshop aims to show the value of Rust despite its complexity. Participants will learn to efficiently distribute workloads, communicate asynchronously, and utilize their computer‚Äôs capabilities using Rust‚Äôs safety features. The session will also explain Rust‚Äôs unique system safety and error prevention approach.

The virtual platform will not only be an essential tool for those joining us remotely, but also for those onsite interested in asking our speakers questions, capturing their experience, and making lasting connections with other attendees and sponsors.

### Rust Global:

Rust Global is a Rust Foundation-hosted half-day event taking place on Friday, September 13th. The event will feature talks and discussions about the use of Rust in enterprise, government, and global leadership settings.
