          <h3 id=""><img width="580" height="326" alt="Orange gradient background with white rust foundation logo up top (letter &quot;R&quot; inside gear icon) with the following white heading text: &quot;Announcing Our Latest Round of Project Grant Recipients”. Underneath is a smaller subheading that reads “Please join us in congratulating these 25 Rust community members who have been selected to receive a Rust Foundation Project Grant as part of our Community Grants Program.”" title="Project Grant Announcement" src="/img/news/2023-01-05-project-grants-announcement/Announcement-Templates.png" /> <a class="direct-link" href="#">#</a></h3>
<p>The Rust Foundation’s <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/">Community Grants Program</a> provides funds to the Rust development community to help support the work of Rust’s hardworking maintainers and leaders. <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/project-grants/"><u>Project Grants</u></a> are a specific subset of financial awards ranging from $2,500 to $15,000 USD that fund short-term Rust-related projects, carried out by both individuals and organizations. In 2022, we held two application rounds for the Community Grants Program: the first in April for Project Grants and <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/fellowships"><u>Fellowships</u></a>, and the second in October 2022, specifically for Project Grants. Today, we are pleased to introduce you to our second round of Rust Foundation Project Grantees. </p>
<h3 id="a-note-to-past-and-prospective-applicants"><strong>A Note to Past and Prospective Applicants</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#a-note-to-past-and-prospective-applicants">#</a></h3>
<p>Our latest round of Project Grants is the result of a month-long application period that resulted in over 100 applications (a more than 300% increase from the earlier application round). With limited funds for the program, we had to make some difficult decisions and couldn’t extend a grant to everyone who proposed meaningful work. If you applied to the last application round but were not selected, please know that we plan to offer more Project Grants in the future and would love to receive another application from you. If you are interested in a Rust Foundation Project Grant but have any doubts about your eligibility or worthiness, we highly encourage you to read<a href="https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/2022/04/19/imposter-syndrome.html"><u>this post on the Inside Rust about Impostor Syndrome</u></a> from Rust Foundation Project Director Jane Lusby on behalf of all our Project Directors.  </p>
<h3 id="application-process-updates-%26-acknowledgements"><strong>Application Process Updates &amp; Acknowledgements</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#application-process-updates-%26-acknowledgements">#</a></h3>
<p>Thank you to past Community Grants Program applicants, Rust Project leadership, and the wider Rust community for sharing their feedback and suggestions for improving our application process. We implemented a number of changes in our second application round this past fall, including clarifying certain portions of the application form itself and offering detailed feedback to all interested applicants. If you have any additional feedback to share for future Community Grants Program application rounds, you can email us at <u><a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a></u>. </p>
<p>We would also like to thank Rust Project leadership for helping the Rust Foundation team throughout the application review process. </p>
<h4 id="hardship-grants-and-event-support-grants-are-available-year-round"><em><strong>Hardship Grants and Event Support Grants Are Available Year-Round</strong></em> <a class="direct-link" href="#hardship-grants-and-event-support-grants-are-available-year-round">#</a></h4>
<p><em>Hardship Grants are financial awards ranging from $500 to $1,500 made to active maintainers of the Rust Project facing financial hardship. Event Support Grants are financial awards ranging from $100 to $500 made to support events (both physical and virtual). Both categories of grants are open for applications year-round. You can learn more </em><a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/"><em><u>here</u></em></a><em>. </em></p>
<h2 id="introducing-our-newest-project-grantees"><strong>Introducing Our Newest Project Grantees</strong> <a class="direct-link" href="#introducing-our-newest-project-grantees">#</a></h2>
<p>The grant recipients listed below demonstrated a commitment to maintain, develop, and/or expand important areas of the Rust ecosystem in their submissions to our second application round. The Rust Foundation believes the work of grantees will result in clear improvements and increased support for Rust users, maintainers, and the entire Rust community. </p>
<p><em>Note: Grantees have been listed by their names, aliases, and/or GitHub usernames based on personal preference. </em></p>
