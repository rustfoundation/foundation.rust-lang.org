The Rust Foundation is thrilled to announce that [Carol Nichols](https://github.com/carols10cents) has been elected as the newest Rust Foundation Project Director. In this position, she will join incumbent Project Directors Ryan Levick, Scott McMurray, Jakub Degan, and Santiago Pastorino to serve on the Rust Foundation Board of Directors. Project Directors are elected by the entity they represent, which in the case of the Rust Project means they are elected by the Rust Leadership Council.

Carol is replacing Mark Rousskov who is stepping down after three years of committed work as a Project Director and Company Secretary. Mark has been a valued colleague on the board, and we are grateful to him for helping us advance the Foundation to where it is today.

Carol has been an active contributor to and leader of the Rust Project for many years. She currently serves on the Rust Project crates.io Team and has previously served on the Project’s Leadership Council, the Dev Tools Team, and the former Rust Core Team. Carol is also a co-founder of [Integer 32, LLC](https://integer32.com/), the world’s first Rust-focused software consultancy, has organized various Rust community events and conferences in the past, and is the co-author of the [Rust Book](https://nostarch.com/rust-programming-language-2nd-edition).

“The Rust Foundation is essential to ensuring the sustainability and independence of the Rust Project, and I’m excited to help with that mission,” said Carol Nichols. “I’m hoping to further increase communication and cooperation between the Project and the Foundation.”

Rust Foundation Executive Director & CEO Rebecca Rumbul said the following about Carol joining the Rust Foundation Board of Directors as our newest Project Director:

“Carol is entering into the Project Director role as a respected leader within the Rust community and will no doubt lend an important, community-focused perspective to the decisions we make as a board. The Foundation is grateful to the Rust Project and the Leadership Council for selecting such a qualified and collaborative representative.”
