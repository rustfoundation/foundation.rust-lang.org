It's been a busy time for the Rust Foundation as the new board of directors gets to know each other and establish its values and goals. I'm excited to announce we have several new Foundation members, including a new Platinum member and our first set of Silver Tier members.

If you are interested in becoming a member- please <a href="/info/contact/">reach out</a>.

## New Platinum Member

* [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/) was an early adopter of Rust and uses it in many aspects of development, from source control to compilers. Joel Marcey will be joining the Board of Directors as Facebook's Member Director. Read more about Joel [in his own words](/posts/2021-04-29-introducing-joel-marcey).

## New Silver Members

* [Zama](https://zama.ai/) builds [open-source homomorphic encryption solutions](https://zama.ai/technology/) for data science and AI. They use Rust throughout, from their cryptographic library to their machine learning frameworks.
* [Ferrous Systems](https://ferrous-systems.com/) improves the Rust ecosystem by providing training and services, and employs maintainers of the Rust compiler. It also enables Rust on embedded, by providing important ecosystem tooling for the embedded space like [knurling](https://knurling.ferrous-systems.com/) and co-maintaining libraries like [nrf-hal](https://github.com/nrf-rs/nrf-hal). Their current hallmark project is [Ferrocene](https://ferrous-systems.com/ferrocene/) to enable Rust in safety-critical spaces.
* [Tag1Consulting](https://www.tag1consulting.com/) is a global technology consulting firm that is an ardent advocate for supporting the open source projects they depend on. They rely on Rust for some of their projects, such as [goose.rs](https://goose.rs), which is a highly scalable loadtesting tool inspired by the Python based Locust Framework.
* [CleverCloud](https://www.clever-cloud.com/) is an IT Automation platform that has been present in the Rust community since early in Rust's history. They proudly contribute to many Rust open source projects, such as [nom](https://crates.io/crates/nom), [sozu](https://github.com/sozu-proxy/sozu0), and many others.
