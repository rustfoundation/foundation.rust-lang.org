### The Rust Foundation is thrilled to congratulate Ernest Kissiedu for receiving an [OpenUK Award](https://openuk.uk/awards/) this year — a testament to his unwavering commitment not only to the Rust community, but also to global access to open source.

In addition to hosting various events and meetups for Rustaceans in London and working with fellow Rust event organizers all over the world, Ernest contributes to the Rust Foundation as our Global Rust Organizer.

The OpenUK Awards celebrate outstanding contributions to open technology, recognizing individuals and organizations that drive innovation, collaboration, and inclusivity in the open source ecosystem. The annual event highlights achievements across various categories, showcasing the impact of open practices on communities worldwide.

Dr. Rebecca Rumbul, Executive Director of the Rust Foundation said the following about Ernest’s impact:

*"Ernest is well-known as the Rust London Meetup and Rust Nation organiser, but he is familiar to Rustaceans all over the world as a result of his tireless efforts to grow the Rust community. He has worked particularly hard to promote diversity and inclusivity in the community, and has supported groups in Asia, the Americas, and Africa to develop their interests and events. We are lucky to work with Ernest here at the Rust Foundation, and I'm delighted that his efforts have been recognised by OpenUK."*

Ernest has made fantastic contributions to the global Rust ecosystem, helping foster collaboration and inclusivity. His work aligns with the Rust Foundation’s mission to support and sustain the Rust community, and we are pleased to see him recognized for his achievements.

Congratulations, Ernest!
