### Overview

The Rust Foundation is pleased to announce the awards of the 2022 Rust Foundation Fellowship Program, and the first tranche of the 2022 Project Grants Program.

As many of you [know](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2021-12-09-news-rust-foundation-to-launch-community-grants-program/) by now, the Community Grants Program is a mechanism to provide funds to the Rust development community to support their work. There will be at least 21 Fellowships and 20 Project grants awarded. We are particularly pleased that grants will be awarded across the globe, with grant recipients spread across 15 countries, with approximately 35% beyond the United States and Western Europe.

The Rust Fellowship award recognises long term contributors to the Rust Project, as well as newer ‘Associate Fellow’ entrants to the maintainer community looking to increase their contributions and skills in order to develop into the Rust leaders of the future. Rust Fellows are sponsored for one year to work on key priority Rust development. Alongside a monthly stipend to support the time they devote to Rust maintenance, Fellows will also receive a program of training, networking, and the opportunity to attend Rust-related events. Fellows and Project grant recipients will be working across the Rust ecosystem, with several focusing on language maintenance and improvement work, documentation, libraries, and learning materials.

The Project Grant awards focus on specific pieces of work, which are time-limited, and clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Awards were made in three categories of project focus: Maintenance and Support, Development and Infrastructure, and Community.

The Rust Foundation received more than 60 applications for funding across the two grant streams. The successful awards represent investment in the maintenance and development of key areas of the Rust ecosystem, and we hope that this will mean tangible benefits for Rust users and maintainers alike, and an improved Rust landscape for all.

*A full list of the Fellowship and Project awards by GitHub ID is available below. More details about the grantees and their work (including potential additional grantees and the values of the project grant awards) will be published on our website shortly.*

### Thank you to our Expert Advisors\!

We are enormously grateful to a number of individuals that took on the role of ‘Expert Advisors’ to the Program in the course of assessing the applications submitted. The technical expertise that they provided means that we are very confident that the work being conducted through the awards will be relevant, high quality, impactful and will not place undue burden on existing maintainers.

### Learning lessons for the future

We have learned a lot of lessons through this first iteration of the Community Grants Program, and as we have committed to doing all along, will likely tweak some of the processes for our next application window. We are proud of how this first application period has developed, but it was never going to be 100% perfect on the first try, and we want to make improvements for next time. We haven't landed on all of the specifics yet (we still have a lot of admin to do on the current awards first\!), but we will definitely revisit some of the information, requirements and administration features.

We were also struck by the number of applicants or potential applicants that expressed extreme reservations about their own skills, to the point of not applying because they didn't think it was worth it. We think it is worth noting that, on a number of these applications, our Expert Advisors provided glowing feedback, and those applicants were ultimately successful. We hope that we can provide more encouragement next time around to ensure that people with great skills know it is worth applying.

### Hardship Grants and Events Grants are live year-round

A quick reminder that these two grant streams are open for applications 24/7. You can find more information [here](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/).
