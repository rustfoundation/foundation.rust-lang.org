We are pleased to announce that Tobias Bieniek joined the Rust Foundation team on April 3, 2023 as our newest Software Engineer. As a member of the Rust Foundation's growing technology team led by Director of Technology, Joel Marcey, Tobias will be focused specifically on serving the Rust programming language's [<u>crates.io</u>](https://crates.io/) Team within the Rust Project.

Tobias has been involved with the Rust ecosystem since roughly 2015. He started out by working to the&nbsp;[<u>intellij-rust project</u>](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) and for the past several years, he has been contributing to the crates.io codebase.

In 2019, Tobias officially joined the [<u>crates.io</u>](http://crates.io/) team and was asked to co-lead the team in May 2021. In mid-2022, Tobias applied for the first round of fellowship grants from the Rust Foundation (part of our&nbsp;[<u>Community Grants Program</u>](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/)) and has been in close contact with the Rust Foundation ever since being accepted as a grantee.

When the&nbsp;[<u>crates.io</u>](https://crates.io/)\-focused software engineering role opened up at the Rust Foundation as part of its ongoing [<u>security initiative</u>](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/), it felt like a natural fit for Tobias who cited being a fan of open source software development and the Rust ecosystem as his primary reason to pursue the position.&nbsp;

Please join us in welcoming Tobias to the Rust Foundation team!
