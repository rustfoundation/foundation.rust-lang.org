DOVER, DELAWARE, November 12, 2024 – The Rust Foundation, an independent non-profit dedicated to stewarding and advancing the Rust programming language, released a comprehensive problem statement addressing the challenges and opportunities in C++ and Rust interoperability. This publication marks a significant step toward making cross-language development more accessible and approachable for the wider programming community.

The problem statement outlines three key strategic approaches:

* Improve existing tools and address tactical issues within the Rust Project to reduce interoperability friction and risk in the short term.
* Build consensus around long-term goals requiring changes to Rust itself and develop the tactical approaches to begin pursuing them.
* Engage with the C++ community and committee to improve the quality of interoperation for both languages to help realize the mutual goals of safety and performance.

## About the Initiative

This “Interop Initiative” was launched in February 2024 with a generous [$1M contribution from Google](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/google-contributes-1m-to-rust-foundation-to-support-c-rust-interop-initiative/). The initiative recognizes that both C++ and Rust have essential roles in the future of systems programming. While both languages excel in similar domains, using them together effectively is crucial for organizations seeking to balance safety and performance with maintainability. The core challenge lies in developing a mature, standardized approach to C++ and Rust interoperability, despite Rust's historical focus on C compatibility.

Under the guidance of [Jon Bauman](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/welcoming-rust-c-interoperability-engineer-jon-bauman-to-the-rust-foundation-team/), who joined as Rust-C++ Interoperability Engineer in June 2024, the Initiative proposes a collaborative, problem-space approach engaging key stakeholders from both language communities. Rather than prescribing specific solutions, this problem statement serves as a foundation for community input and participation in shaping both the strategic direction and tactical implementation of improved C++/Rust interoperability.

## Get Involved

We welcome feedback on this problem statement and participation from the community. Here's how you can engage with the Interop Initiative:

* Join the discussion in the [t-lang/interop](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/427678-t-lang.2Finterop) Zulip channel
* Email your suggestions to [interop@rustfoundation.org]()
* Follow the Rust Foundation blog for regular updates
* Review and comment on the [full problem statement](https://github.com/rustfoundation/interop-initiative)

Progress updates will be shared through these channels and presented to the Rust Foundation board, which includes members of the Rust Project.
