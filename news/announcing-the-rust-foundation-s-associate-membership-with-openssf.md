Today, the Rust Foundation is pleased to announce that <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://openssf.org/press-release/2023/09/18/openssf-welcomes-new-members-in-support-of-securing-open-source-software/">we have joined the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) as an Associate Member</a>.&nbsp;

This Associate Membership formalizes our existing partnership with [<u>OpenSSF</u>](https://openssf.org/), an organization that has provided the Rust Foundation with generous financial support through Alpha-Omega: a project that works with the maintainers of the most critical open source projects to help them improve their security.&nbsp;

Through the [<u>Alpha-Omega Project</u>](https://openssf.org/community/alpha-omega/), OpenSSF was key in helping to kickstart the [<u>Rust Foundation's Security Initiative</u>](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/new-rust-foundation-report-details-security-initiative-progress/), which facilitates security improvements to the Rust programming language ecosystem.&nbsp;

Associate Membership enables non-profit organizations like ours to formally join forces with OpenSSF and the Linux Foundation, allowing us to better support the growth and evolution of open source security together.

### **The Rust Foundation’s Executive Director & CEO, Rebecca Rumbul, said the following about the news:**&nbsp;

> *“ The Rust Foundation is an independent, nonprofit organization dedicated to the performance, safety, and sustainability of the Rust programming language and its global community. OpenSSF has been a prominent advocate of the Rust Foundation’s work to bolster the security of Rust, most notably through Alpha-Omega’s generous funding of our Security Initiative. We are thrilled to solidify our relationship with OpenSSF through this Associate Membership and we look forward to working collaboratively for the good of the entire open source landscape.”*&nbsp;
