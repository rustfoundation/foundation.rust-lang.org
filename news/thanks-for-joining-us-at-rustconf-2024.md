The Rust Foundation was thrilled to organize and host RustConf for the first time in 2024. While this beloved Rust programming language community gathering has taken place for many years, this marks the first year the Foundation has managed the event without using an external contractor. Over time, RustConf has evolved into a must-attend event for many community members, and we’re deeply grateful to the dedicated people who have made it possible.

## Content Recap

This year, we were excited to have an excellent group of speakers, including keynoters:

* Aeva Black of CISA
* Jack Huey and James Munns from the Rust Project Leadership Council
* Miguel Ojeda from the Rust for Linux Project
* Niko Matsakis — Co-Lead of the Rust Language Design Team.

Overall, we had 4 keynotes, 22 RustConf session talks, 6 Rust Global talks, 15+ community talks in the community room, and 3 hands-on workshops. We were also grateful to have the support of our excellent emcees, Nell Shamrell-Harrington and Ernest Kissiedu.

Several of our sponsors also gave engaging lighting talks and quick demos onstage. There was a lively atmosphere—not just in Montreal but also on the virtual RustConf Discord Server, where over 1200 general attendees and virtual-only ticket holders alike convened, connected, and rounded out the RustConf experience.

On Friday, the Rust Foundation team hosted a mini-conference called Rust Global, dedicated to discussions about the professional use of Rust worldwide. We’re excited to continue hosting more installments of Rust Global, not just alongside RustConf, but also in various countries around the world.

We’d also like to extend a special thanks to Bart Massey for leading a successful and engaging Unconf, an event for freeform discussions with members of the Rust Project and community ,which drew over 100 participants.

## A Sold Out Event

We were amazed by the level of interest in attending RustConf this year! Over 600 Rustaceans registered to join us in person. All exhibiting sponsorships sold out, as did workshops — it was a packed house! Because of the demand, we look forward to offering more workshop spots next year.

## Attendee Perspectives

We’re pleased to report that participants rated RustConf 2024 highly, with an overall satisfaction score of 4 out of 5. Many attendees also expressed a strong likelihood of recommending the event to others. The talks and content were highlighted as their favorite aspects, followed closely by the opportunity to connect with other Rust community members and project leaders.

We know that some aspects of the event could be improved. For instance, the second track room was often crowded, and navigating the venue at times was challenging. We're actively addressing this feedback, along with other suggestions from our attendees, as we plan RustConf 2025. Our goal is to create an even better experience for everyone next year.

We expect to receive all the talk recordings shortly and will upload them to YouTube as soon as possible. We know many of you have been asking about them, and rest assured—they’ll be available soon.

## Save the Date

As you might have seen from previous communications, we intend to hold the next RustConf from September 2 to 5, 2025! Stay tuned for the location announcement.

## Thank you!

Thank you so much to our amazing speakers, sponsors, volunteers/staff, Program Committee, and everyone who participated in person and online. We can’t wait to do it all again next year and make the event even better.
