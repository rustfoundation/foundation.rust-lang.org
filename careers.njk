    <h1>Careers at the Rust Foundation</h1>
    
    <h2>How our recruitment process works</h2>

<div>

<p>Read through our website to learn more about the Foundation and the work we do. If you feel you’re a good fit, then submit your application.</p>

<p>We use <a href="https://www.beapplied.com/">Applied</a> as our recruitment platform because we fully believe in their mission of unbiased hiring. Instead of a resume and cover letter, we’ll ask you to show us your ability to do the job by answering a small number of skills-focused questions. You’ll upload your resume as part of your application, but nobody will see it (or your name, or anything else about you) until your answers have been reviewed.</p>

<p>We generally don’t deal with professional recruitment agencies or accept unsolicited resumes – all applications will need to be submitted via our Applied page for a specific vacancy.</p>

<p>After the closing date for the advertisement, you can expect to hear back from us within no more than 10 working days. If we decide we’re not going to invite you to an interview, we’ll try to give you any useful feedback that we can about why not.</p>

<p>At the interview (which will usually be a video call), you will meet members of the team, learn more about the context and requirements of the role, and help us to clarify our understanding of your suitability for it. It’s a conversation – you’re interviewing the Foundation as much as the Foundation is interviewing you. And again, if we decide not to offer you the role, we will let you know promptly, and we will give you useful feedback about why not.</p>

<p>We're looking for a Rust Infrastructure Engineer! Fully remote; open to applicants globally (collaboration with U.S. West Coast and Europe will be required); competitive salary based on location.</p>

<p>The Rust Foundation’s mission is to steward the Rust Language through actively supporting the maintainers that develop and govern the project. The primarily volunteer <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance/teams/infra">Rust Infrastructure team</a> is responsible for supporting the Rust project by providing services and systems to allow for the efficient and productive development, building and testing of the Rust language, including Continuous Integration (CI), account management, and bot development.</p>

<p>The Rust Infrastructure Engineer will be responsible for the operations of all currently supported and future infrastructure, including managing both existing tools and new development.

<h2>What's it like to work here?</h2>

<p>Founded in 2021, the Rust Foundation is a virtual, international organization with an all-remote workforce. We have a small team of full time staff in the USA and the UK, and ambitions to grow over the next few years.</p>

<p>Founding members of the team have many years of experience at remote working. We’re proud of being able to facilitate close collaboration without being in the same office, or even in the same time zone. We communicate primarily via Google Meet, Slack and email, and are evolving a culture of daily stand-ups and regular check-ins on important projects.</p>

<p>We support our team in working from home effectively, providing a work laptop, other essential kit, and advice on how to optimize your setup. If you prefer to take a co-working space, we’ll cover the costs. Flexible working patterns are fully supported, and we trust you to organize your own hours and your workload in the way that works best for you.</p>

<p>At this point we are still operating very much in startup mode, so our benefits program is yet to be fully established. We are a nonprofit (501(c)6), so whilst we’ll always have reference to prevailing market rates, it may not be possible for us to offer benefits that are directly comparable with or can compete with those on offer elsewhere. Our goal is to provide attractive benefits packages, based on employee feedback about what is important to them, that are comparable across jurisdictions.</p>

<p>You don’t need to know Rust to work here, or even any other programming language (for most roles, anyway) – what you do need is an interest in helping a community of people all over the world work together to achieve a common goal. Experience in software or open source projects is a bonus but not something we’re exclusively looking for.</p>
