(a) Only the legal entity which has been accepted as a Member of the Foundation and its Subsidiaries (as defined below) shall be entitled to enjoy the rights and privileges of such Membership; provided, however, that such Member and its Subsidiaries (that have not themselves been accepted as Members) shall be treated together as a single Member. For purposes of this Section, the term "Subsidiaries" shall mean all Related Companies (as defined below) that a Member controls or is affiliated with (as defined in Section 2.7(b) below).

(c) For purposes of these Bylaws, the term "Related Company" shall mean any entity which controls or is controlled by a Member, or which, together with a Member, is under the common control of a third party, in each case where such control results from ownership, either directly or indirectly, of more than fifty percent (50%) of the voting securities or membership interests of the entity in question; and "Related Companies" are entities that are each a Related Company of a Member.

(e) Except as may be approved by the Board of Directors, Memberships shall be non-transferable, non-salable and non-assignable, except that any Member may transfer its current Membership benefits and obligations to a successor to substantially all of its business and/or assets, whether by merger, sale or otherwise; provided that the transferee agrees to be bound by these By-laws, the Certificate of Incorporation and such policies and procedures as the Board may from time to time adopt.

### Section 2.8 Additional Classes of Members

The conditions, privileges, powers, and voting rights (if any) of any class of Members may be changed, and one or more additional classes of Membership may be created, and the conditions, voting rights (if any), powers and privileges of each such class may be prescribed, by amendment to these Bylaws in accordance with Article XV.

### Section 2.9 Termination or Suspension of Membership

Any Member may be suspended from Membership or have its Membership terminated by the Board for failure to satisfy its Membership Obligations or for engaging in any conduct, either within or without the Foundation, that is contrary to the Purposes of the Foundation, including a violation of any Code of Conduct (“CoC”) from time to time approved by the Board. Once due process has been followed and all appeals exhausted, an individual Member’s Membership may be suspended or terminated in the case of such a violation, and a Corporate Member’s Membership may be suspended until it takes such action to address a CoC violation after receiving notice and the expiration of a reasonable opportunity to act on that notice. Financial Obligations already paid shall not be refundable upon any such termination or suspension, and all Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of the date of such termination shall remain due and payable. Terminations or suspensions of Membership for failure to satisfy Financial Obligations within 90 days of invoice may be imposed with notice and without right of formal appeal under such procedures as the Board may from time to time approve. Except as provided in the last paragraph of this Section 2.9, no termination or suspension of Membership for any other purpose shall be effective unless:

(a) The Member is given notice of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership and of the reasons therefor;

(b) Such notice is delivered personally by email, with delivery confirmed, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by a national or international overnight courier service, sent to the last address of the Member shown on the Foundation’s records;

(c) Such notice is given at least thirty days prior to the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension of Membership;

(d) Such notice sets forth a procedure determined by the Board (or other body authorized by the Board) to decide whether or not the proposed termination or suspension shall take place, whereby the Member is given the opportunity to be heard by such body, either orally (and represented by counsel if the Member so desires, at its sole cost and expense) or in writing, not less than five days before the effective date of the proposed termination or suspension; and

(e) Such termination or suspension of Membership is approved by Supermajority Vote of the Board.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Board believes in good faith that a Member is engaging in willful misconduct or otherwise acting to the material detriment of the best interests of the Foundation and its Members, the Board, acting by Supermajority Vote, may suspend such Member’s Membership immediately, provided that such Member is otherwise afforded the protections provided for in subsections (a), (b) and (d) of this Section 2.9.

### Section 2.10 Resignation by Member

A Member may resign as a Member at any time by giving notice to the Foundation in writing or by electronic transmission. Any Financial Obligations already paid by such Member shall not be refundable in such event, and all such Financial Obligations of such Member which may be accrued and unpaid as of such date shall remain due and payable.

### Section 2.11 Levy of Dues, Assessments or Fees

The Foundation may levy Fees upon its Members in such amounts as may be approved from time to time by the Board, provided, however, that no increase in annual Fees or new Fees will be effective prior to sixty (60) days following notice from the Foundation. A Member upon learning of any increase in dues, or of any levy of any assessments or fees, may avoid liability therefor by resigning from Membership prior to the date such dues, assessments or fees are due and payable, except where the Member is, by contract with the Foundation or otherwise, independently and explicitly liable for such dues, assessments or fees. No provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of the Foundation authorizing such dues, assessments or fees shall, of itself, create such liability. In no event shall the failure of a Member to pay any dues or assessments give rise to any claim in favor of the Foundation for indirect or consequential damages.

### Section 2.12 Use of Names

Unless otherwise provided herein or pursuant to the terms of another agreement or as otherwise legally permitted, neither the Foundation nor any Member shall use the name, logo, trademark, service mark or other distinctive mark of a Member in any form of publicity unless such Member gives its permission in writing or by electronic transmission, provided that the Foundation and any Member may each disclose and publicize such Member’s Membership in the Foundation.

### Section 2.13 Rights in Intellectual Property

The Members and Board shall neither adopt, nor make any material change to: (1) any intellectual property rights policy of the Foundation or any other material policy or procedure of the Foundation governing intellectual property (individually and collectively, as the context requires, an "IP Policy"), or (2) any proposed or requested change to any requirement or obligation in the Bylaws to seek or obtain the consent by a Supermajority Vote of the Directors, unless approved by a Supermajority Vote of the Directors and the Foundation gives not less than sixty (60) days’ prior written notice to all Members of the effective date of such adoption or change, such that any Member may resign its Membership prior to the effective date thereof in accordance with Section 2.10 above. A material change shall be deemed to include, without limitation, the imposition of any patent license obligation or encumbrance on Members, a change in a contribution agreement or license applicable to Members’ contributions, the combination or formal affiliation of the Foundation with another organization, any alteration in the definition of "Related Company," or a change in the IP Policy relating to the choice and/or approval of exceptions of outbound licenses for software developed by the Projects (the "Open Source Software").

## Article III: Actions of Members

### Section 3.1 Place of Meetings; Action Without Meeting

(a) Any face to face meetings of the Members shall physically be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware, or as may otherwise be permitted by law, and at such time as may be fixed from time to time by the Board of Directors or President, or if not so designated, at the registered office of the Foundation. Any such meeting shall be held, and any notice of such meeting shall be given, in compliance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

(b) Notwithstanding Section 3.1(a) above, the Foundation intends to ordinarily conduct all Member activities permitted or required under the General Corporation Law of Delaware on an electronic consent basis. Accordingly, any action required or permitted to be taken by the Members, or any class of Members under the General Corporation Law of Delaware, or at any meeting of a Member Committee, Working Group thereof or other group of Members or subset of Members, may be taken without prior notice and without an in-person vote, if a consent in writing, setting forth the action to be taken, shall be signed by Members (or all members of a class of Members, as the case may be), making up not less than that percentage of all Members as would be necessary to authorize or take such action at a meeting at which all Members (or class of Members, as the case may be) entitled to vote thereon were present and voted, in accordance with the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

Prompt electronic notice of the taking of any corporate action without a meeting by less than unanimous written consent shall be given to those otherwise entitled to vote thereon who have not consented in writing. An electronic transmission consenting to an action to be taken and transmitted by a Member or by a person or persons authorized to act for a Member or proxyholder, shall be deemed to be written, signed and dated for the purposes of this Section, provided that any such electronic transmission sets forth or is delivered with information from which the Foundation can determine (a) that the electronic transmission was transmitted by the Member or by a person or persons authorized to act for the Member and (b) the date on which such Member or authorized person or persons transmitted such electronic transmission. The date on which such electronic transmission is transmitted shall be deemed to be the date on which such consent was signed. Consents given by electronic transmission (i) may be delivered by electronic transmission to the principal place of business of the Foundation or to an Officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded, need not be reproduced in paper form, and may be maintained in electronic form as long as they are capable of being readily reproduced in paper form, and (ii) may be otherwise delivered to the principal place of business of the Foundation or to an Officer or agent of the Foundation having custody of the book in which actions of Members without a meeting are recorded if, to the extent and in the manner provided by resolution of the Board.

Any copy, facsimile or other reliable reproduction of a consent in writing may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing for any and all purposes for which the original writing could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of the entire original writing.

### Section 3.2 Nomination and Election Procedures

Subject to the provisions of Section 4.3, the Board shall establish reasonable nomination and election procedures given the nature, size, and operations of the Foundation, including a reasonable means for Members of appropriate classes to nominate a person for election as a Director, a reasonable opportunity for a nominee to communicate to the Members the nominee’s qualifications and the reasons for the nominee’s candidacy (if requested by such nominee), a reasonable opportunity for all nominees to solicit votes (if requested by any such nominee), and a reasonable opportunity for all Members entitled to vote thereon to choose among the nominees.

### Section 4.3 Nomination, Election and Term of Office of Directors

(a) Each Platinum Member (while remaining in good standing), acting as its own single class of Membership, shall be entitled individually to nominate and elect one Director (each a “Platinum Director”). Each Platinum Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(g) below for a term of two (2) years or until their successor shall be duly elected or until their earlier resignation or removal.

(b) Each Gold Member (while remaining in good standing) shall have the right to vote, together with the other Gold Members as a class, to elect Directors (each, a “Gold Director”), as follows: if the number of Gold Members is (x) between four (4) and seven (7), there shall be one Gold Director; and (y) eight (8) or more, there shall be two (2) Gold Directors.

Election of the Silver Director, when appropriate, shall be held biannually. If the threshold for the addition of a Silver Director shall be reached between biannual elections, the Board shall call an interim election to fill such seat. In the event the number of Silver Members falls below the threshold for a Silver Director between biannual elections, the sitting Silver Director shall complete their term and the Silver Director seat shall be eliminated or maintained, as appropriate, at the next biannual election based upon the then current number of Silver Members.

Each Silver Director shall serve in accordance with Section 4.3(g) below for a term of two (2) years or until their earlier resignation or removal.

(e) The Executive Director shall serve ex-officio as a non-voting member of the Board.

(f) The selection of nominees for any elected Director position shall be performed under such nominating procedures as may be set by the Board from time to time. Any Director elected by any class of Members, or by a Platinum Member, may, but shall not automatically, be re-nominated and re-elected for additional terms.

(g) Each Corporate Director shall, at the time of their election, be an employee of the Member which nominated them. No person may be elected Project Director if, at the time of election, that person is employed by a Corporate Member and that Corporate Member or any Related Company already employs a Project Director. Each Director shall hold office until the earliest to occur of the expiration of the term for which such Director was elected and such Director’s successor is elected (as the case may be) and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal. If, during the term of any Corporate Director: (i) the Director’s employment is terminated by the Member that they represent or by such Director, such Director shall be deemed to have resigned as a Corporate Director. In addition, during such times as the Membership of any Member that has a representative serving as a Corporate Director is suspended pursuant to Section 2.9 above, the attendance and voting rights of such Corporate Director shall also be suspended until such time, if ever, as the suspension of such Member is lifted.

(h) Each Director may designate in writing or by electronic transmission to the Chairperson or Secretary (which designation may be withdrawn in writing at any time by such Director or Member) an individual to act as a Director in their stead, whether for a single meeting or as a standing alternate. Any such alternate Director shall be entitled to (i) attend and vote at all meetings which the designating Director does not attend, (ii) sign all written consents in lieu of the designating Director, and (iii) otherwise exercise the duties and enjoy the privileges of the designating Director in the absence or unavailability of the designating Director; provided, however, that no such alternate Director may propose a vote or vote upon any Committee of the Board.

(i) The Board may approve from time to time such reasonable attendance and other requirements as it shall deem to be advisable to ensure that seats on the Board are held by active, contributing individuals. Such rules may provide that any Member which has nominated a Director, or nominated and elected a Director, as the case may be, may lose its ability to a nominate, or nominate and elect, a representative to the Board, as the case may be, in the event that such requirements have not been met, and/or that a Director who fails to meet such requirements shall automatically be deemed to have resigned from the Board, but no such rule may be imposed retroactively.

Subject to Section 2.8 above and Section 4.10 below, the number of Directors, the persons eligible to become Directors and the classes of Members eligible to elect and/or nominate Directors may be amended at any time by a Supermajority Vote (as defined in Section 4.10(b)) of the Board.

### Section 4.5 Resignation and Removal

Any Director may resign at any time upon notice to the Foundation in writing or by electronic transmission at the principal place of business of the Foundation or to the Chairperson or Secretary.

Any Director who was elected by a Platinum Member under Section 4.3(a) may be removed by that Platinum Member at any time, and for any reason, or for no reason. Any or all of the Directors who were elected by a class of Members voting as a class or by the Board may be removed by a majority vote of such class of Members or the Board, respectively. Unless otherwise specified by law or the Certificate of Incorporation, any Director may be removed by a Supermajority Vote of the other Directors (not counting the Director subject to such removal vote in determining the requisite vote) for engaging within the Foundation, in their capacity as Director, in any (1) violating the Foundation’s Code of Conduct or otherwise engaging in willful misconduct or acting to the material detriment of the best interests of the Foundation and its Members, or (2) conduct that is contrary to the Purpose of the Foundation or to the advancement of the Foundation’s business or industry goals, as reasonably determined in good faith by such other Directors; provided, however, that the Member or class of Members that nominated, or nominated and elected (as the case may be) such removed Director shall be entitled to nominate, or nominate and elect (as the case may be) a replacement for such removed Director to serve for the balance of such removed Director’s term.

Unless written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another provision of these Bylaws, and subject to the provisions below relating to notice by electronic transmission to Members, written notice may be given by electronic mail, telecopy, commercial delivery service, or similar means, addressed to such Director or Member at his, her or its physical, email, or telecopy address or number as it appears on the records of the Foundation. Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to Members, any notice to Members given by the Foundation under any provision of law, the Certificate of Incorporation, or the Bylaws, unless written notice by mail is required by law, the Certificate of Incorporation or another provision of these Bylaws, shall be effective if given by a form of electronic transmission to any Member who has not notified the Foundation in writing or by electronic transmission of their objection to receiving notice by electronic transmission.

(b) Notice given pursuant to this Section shall be deemed given: (i) if by electronic mail to (A) a Member, when directed to the Member’s electronic mail address and (B) to a Director, when directed to the electronic mail address for such Director as it appears on the records of the Foundation; (ii) if by a posting on an electronic network together with separate notice to the Member or Director of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice; (iii) if by facsimile telecommunication (A) to a Member, when directed to a number at which the Member has consented to receive notice and (B) to a Director, when directed to the number for such Director as it appears on the records of the Foundation; (iv) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the Member or Director; (v) if by hand delivery or oral notice, at the time it is actually given; (vi) if by mail, at the time when the notice is deposited in the United States mail; and (vii) if by commercial delivery carrier or similar means, at the time when the notice is deposited with the carrier, in each case the transmission charge to be paid by the Foundation or the person sending such notice and not by the addressee. An affidavit of the Secretary or an Assistant Secretary or of the transfer agent or other agent of the Foundation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

(c) For purposes of these Bylaws, “electronic transmission” means any form of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved, and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process.

(d) Without limiting the foregoing, the Foundation adopts electronic mail as its principal source of communication with its Members. Each Member acknowledges and agrees that the Foundation shall not be under any obligation (except as required by law or these Bylaws) to send any notice to any Member by any means other than electronic mail, and it is therefore the responsibility of each Member to avail itself of and make such arrangements as may be necessary to receive notice in such fashion.

### Section 7.2 Waiver of Notice

Whenever any notice is required to be given under the provisions of law or of the Certificate of Incorporation or of these Bylaws, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the person or persons entitled to said notice, whether before or after the time stated therein, or a waiver by electronic transmission by the person entitled to notice, shall be deemed equivalent thereto.

## Article VIII: Indemnification

### Section 8.1 Actions other than by or in the Right of the Foundation

Subject to confirmation of the appropriateness of such action by the Board as provided in Section 8.4 below, the Foundation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in the right of the Foundation) by reason of the fact that the person is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, or is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys’ fees), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if the person acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceedings, had no reasonable cause to believe this conduct was unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction, or upon a plea of nolo contendere or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a presumption that the person did not act in good faith and in a manner which they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Foundation, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that their conduct was unlawful.

### Section 8.2 Actions by or in the Right of the Foundation

Subject to confirmation of the appropriateness of such action by the Board as provided in Section 8.4 below, the Foundation shall indemnify any person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the Foundation to procure a judgment in its favor by reason of the fact that the person is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, or is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by the person in connection with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if the person acted in good faith and in a manner they reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the Foundation; provided, however, that no indemnification shall be made in respect of any claim, issue or matter as to which such person shall have been adjudged to be liable unless, and only to the extent that, the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or the court in which such action or suit was brought shall determine upon application that, despite the adjudication of liability but in view of all the circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably entitled to indemnity for such expenses which the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware or such other court shall deem proper.

### Section 8.3 Success on the Merits

To the extent that any person described in Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII has been successful on the merits or otherwise in defense of any action, suit or proceeding referred to in said Sections, or in defense of any claim, issue or matter therein, they shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys’ fees) actually and reasonably incurred by them in connection therewith.

### Section 8.4 Specific Authorization

Any indemnification under Section 8.1 or 8.2 of this Article VIII (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Foundation only as authorized in the specific case upon a determination that indemnification of any person described in said Sections is proper in the circumstances because the person has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in said Sections. Such determination shall be made (a) by a majority vote of such Directors who were not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though less than a quorum or (b) by the Members of the Foundation.

### Section 8.5 Advance Payment

Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Foundation in advance of the final disposition of such action, suit or proceeding upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of any person described in said Section to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that the person is not entitled to indemnification by the Foundation as authorized in this Article VIII.

### Section 8.6 Non-Exclusivity

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, the other Sections of this Article VIII shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those provided indemnification or advancement of expenses may be entitled under any Bylaw, agreement, vote of disinterested Directors or otherwise, both as to action in an official capacity and as to action in another capacity while holding such office.

### Section 8.7 Jurisdiction of Delaware Court of Chancery

The Delaware Court of Chancery is vested with exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all actions for advancement of expenses or indemnification. The Delaware Court of Chancery may summarily determine the Foundation’s obligation to advance expenses (including attorney’s fees).

### Section 8.8 Insurance

The Board may authorize the Foundation to purchase and maintain insurance on behalf of any person who is or was a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Foundation, or is or was serving at the request of the Foundation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise against any liability asserted against that person and incurred by them in any such capacity, or arising out of their status as such, whether or not the Foundation would have the power to indemnify the person against such liability under the provisions of this Article VIII.

### Section 8.9 Continuation of Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses

The indemnification and advancement of expenses provided by, or granted pursuant to, this Article VIII shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a Director, Officer, employee or agent of the Foundation and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

### Section 8.10 Severability

If any word, clause or provision of this Article VIII or any award made hereunder shall for any reason be determined to be invalid, the provisions hereof shall not otherwise be affected thereby but shall remain in full force and effect.

### Section 8.11 Intent of Article

The intent of this Article VIII is to provide for indemnification and advancement of expenses to the fullest extent permitted by Section 145 of the General Corporation Law of Delaware.

(a) The material facts as to the person’s relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to the Board or such Board Committee, and the Board or such Board Committee in good faith authorizes the contract or transaction by the affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested Directors, even though the disinterested Directors be less than a quorum; or
