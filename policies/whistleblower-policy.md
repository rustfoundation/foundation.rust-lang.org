## Policy statement

The Rust Foundation is committed to the highest possible standards of transparency, probity and accountability. In line with that commitment we want staff members and directors who have serious concerns about any aspect of the organization’s work to feel that they can come forward and voice those concerns. We seek to enable everyone to raise concerns within the organization via our general working practices and our [Code of Conduct](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/), so that they do not feel they have to ‘blow the whistle’ outside. However, if an internal approach is either not possible or unsuccessful, staff members and directors are encouraged to raise their concerns in public.

## Definitions

Like other whistleblower policies, this policy protects individuals who report activities believed to be illegal, dishonest, unethical, or otherwise improper. The term ‘whistleblowing’ specifically refers to the disclosure of concerns that are of public interest:
* Conduct which is an offense or a breach of law
* Disclosures related to miscarriages of justice
* Health and safety risks, including risks to the public as well as to other staff members
* Damage to the environment
* The unauthorized use of the organization’s funds
* Possible fraud and corruption
* Abuse of authority
* Other unethical conduct

It is not necessary for the whistleblower to have proof; a reasonable belief is sufficient.

## How to raise a concern

As a first step, an individual should normally raise concerns with their immediate manager. However, if the concern relates to their manager, they should instead approach a more senior manager or a member of the board of directors. Concerns should be raised in writing, setting out the background and history, with names, dates and places where possible.

The whistleblower is not responsible for investigating the alleged illegal or dishonest activity, or for determining fault or corrective measures. Appropriate management officials will be assigned these responsibilities. The investigation will be objective and evidence-based, and will produce a report that focuses on identifying and rectifying any issues, and learning lessons to prevent problems recurring. In the event that misconduct is discovered, the organization’s disciplinary policy will be invoked alongside any external measures that may be necessary, such as informing the police or another official body. The whistleblower will be informed of the outcome of the investigation and what the Foundation has done or proposes to do as a result.

In so far as possible, the whistleblower’s confidentiality will be maintained. The Foundation will not, without their consent, disclose their identity to anyone other than a person involved in the investigation. However, if the allegation is of the type that could eventually result in court proceedings, then the whistleblower should be aware that they may have to give evidence in open court if the case is to be successful.

Any staff member or director who is raising concerns should keep a dated record of all conversations and communication in relation to the issue they have raised. If they are not satisfied with the response, they may escalate the issue to the chair of the board (or to any other member of the board, if the chair provided the first response).

The Foundation will take appropriate action to protect a whistleblower from any reprisals, harassment or victimization – including if the allegation is found to be unsubstantiated.

## Distribution
