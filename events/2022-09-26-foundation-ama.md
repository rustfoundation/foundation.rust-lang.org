This quarter, our AMA will be led by Rust Foundation Project Directors Jane Lusby and Ryan Levick, and moderated by Sage Griffin.

Jane and Ryan will share their experience of serving on the Foundation's board. Board membership comes with the privilege of helping to steer the organization's direction, but also the challenge of balancing a director's personal views (and their employer's) with the feedback they receive from the community, and the mission and best interests of the Foundation.
