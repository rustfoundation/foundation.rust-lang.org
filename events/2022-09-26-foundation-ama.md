This quarter, our AMA will be led by Rust Foundation Project Directors Jane Lusby and Ryan Levick, and moderated by Sage Griffin.

Jane and Ryan will share their experience of serving on the Foundation's board and shaping the Foundation's approach. The Project Director role includes many responsibilities, including ensuring that the Foundation is well run, well funded and taking the right strategic approach, and that it is balancing the needs of the Project and the communities with the interests of the membership and the long-term sustainability and growth of the Rust language. 

Join us to hear about Jane and Ryan's experiences and ask any questions you have about their approach.
