Our most recent Rust Foundation AMA took place on April 11th. Our Executive Director and CEO Bec Rumbul, joined by Foundation staff members Paul Lenz and Joel Marcey, shared the latest updates, discussed the Foundation's Community Grant Program, and answered questions from attendees.

Thanks to Sage Griffin for moderating the conversation\! We'll have a video and a transcript of it available here in due course.
