Rust Week 2025 is organized by Stichting Rust Nederland, [RustNL]() for short, and a team of organizers and volunteers.

The first two editions of the event RustNL 2023 (275 attendees) and RustNL 2024 (450) provided a stepping stone towards this yearâ€™s event: a full week of exciting Rust content and the first Rust project All Hands since 2019!
