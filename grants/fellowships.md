<center><h1>Rust Foundation Fellowship Program</h1>
<div>
<br />
<p>The Rust Foundation Fellowship program exists to support and acknowledge active members of the Rust programming language community who generously contribute their time and expertise on a voluntary basis. These grants reward individuals who have helped make Rust what it is today and are key to its future success.</p>
<br />
<p>Rust Foundation Fellows are selected for their Rust experience and potential to enhance the community. Benefits include a monthly stipend during the Fellowship year, funding for career development, and access to mentorship opportunities.</p></div></center>

 <br>

### Rust Foundation Fellowships will be returning in 2024 for their third year, with a target start date for the new cohort of July 31.

The approach to our Fellowships this year will be similar to the previous years with the following adjustments:

* The monthly stipend will increase from $1,000 to $1,500.
* Following grantee feedback, the $2,000 training budget and the $2,000 travel budget will be combined into a single $4,000 allowance.
* Of this combined allowance, up to $1,500 can also be spent on hardware.

  &nbsp;

The total award for each Fellow will therefore be $22,000 per Fellow for the year. We will make up to 15 Fellowship awards in 2024.
