<center><h1>Rust Foundation Fellowship Program</h1>
<div>
<br>
<p>Applications are now closed for the 2024 round of Rust Foundation Fellowships. We will inform applicants of the outcome of their application by the end of August.</p></center>
<br>
<h3>Project Fellowships</h3>
<p>These Fellowships are open to members of the Rust Project Teams and Working Groups to support contributions that serve the goals of the Rust Project Teams and Working Groups. These Fellowships will run for a period of 12 months, during which period Fellows will receive:</p>
<p>- A stipend of $1,500 USD per month</p>
<p>- Combined travel, hardware & training allowance - $4,000  (of which up to $1,500 can be spent on hardware).</p>
<br>
<p><i><center>If you are a team/working group member who would like to work purely on Rust Project Goals (that relate to your Team or Working Group), you should apply for a Project Goal Fellowship. If you would like to work on multiple work items (that can include Project Goals), you should apply for a Project Fellowship.</i></br></center>

<h3>Community Fellowships</h3>
<p>These Fellowships are open to people working to build Rust communities outside of Western Europe and North America to support work such as organizing communities and events and creating content and training materials for their communities.
These Fellowships will run for a period of 12 months, during which period Fellows will receive:</p>
<p>- A stipend of $1,500 USD per month</p>
<p>- Combined travel, hardware & training allowance - $4,000  (up to $1,500 can be spent on hardware).</p>

<br>
<h3>Project Goal Fellowships</h3>
<p>Project Goal Fellowships are open to people working on the agreed <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/proposed.html">goals</a> (and sub-goals) of the Rust Project. Applicants do not have to be members of a Rust Project Team or Working Group, but they do need the skills and experience to be able to deliver their chosen package of work.</p>

<p>Project Goal Fellowships will reflect the calendar of the Rust Project goals and will run for a period of six months. Fellows will receive:</p>
<p>- A stipend of $1,500 USD per month</p>
<p>- Combined travel, hardware & training allowance - $2,000  (up to $750 can be spent on hardware). (The lower values reflect the shorter duration of the Fellowships.)</p>
<br>
<p><i><center>Project Goal Fellowships can be extended beyond six months if it takes longer than six months to complete the goal, or if the Fellow selects a goal from the 2025H1 list of goals to work on for another six months. Applicants need not complete an entire goal or sub-goal as part of their Fellowship, but must be contributing to its completion. Applicants should read the <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-project-goals/2024h2/proposed.html">list of goals</a> before applying as they will need to select a goal as part of their application.</i></p></center>
