</details>

<details>
  <summary>If I become a Fellow do I have to increase the number of hours I spend working on Rust?</summary>
  <p>No. If you are already spending 20 or more hours a month working on the Rust project, then no additional hours will be necessary. We encourage Fellows to limit the additional amount of time they spend working on the project to help achieve a healthy work-life balance.</p>

<details>
  <summary>How does the travel stipend work?</summary>
  <p>Fellows will be asked to inform the Rust Foundation of the Rust-focused event they want to attend during their Fellowship year.

The travel budget (limited to $2,000 USD per Fellow) is intended to provide economy travel, accommodation and subsistence, plus the cost of event admission.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How does the training stipend work?</summary>
  <p>The Rust Foundation team will work with each Fellow to understand the type of training support that would be valuable to them. We require training to be relevant to the Fellowship position.

  <p>No. Each Rust Foundation Fellowship is for an individual.</p>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>How will my work be monitored during the program?</summary>

</details>

<details>
