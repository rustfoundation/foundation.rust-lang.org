<center><h1>Rust Foundation Project Grants</h1>
<div>
<br>
<p>Rust Foundation Project Grants exist to support specific packages of work that benefit Rust. Project Grants will be awarded to both individuals and teams, whether you're a member of a Rust Project Team or Working Group or not. Additionally, Project Grants are available for non-coding education/outreach work.</p>
<br>
<p>Any work that benefits the Rust Project is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. </p></center>
<br>
<h3><center><i>The 2023 Rust Foundation Project Grant application is currently closed. Please stay tuned for news of future Project Grant application periods.</i></center></h3>
