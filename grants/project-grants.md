The Rust Foundation is currently fundraising for the 2023 Community Grants Program. If you are interested in supporting future Project Grant cohorts, then we would love you to <a href="mailto:contact@rustfoundation.org">get in touch</a>!

## Summary

The Rust Foundation Project Grants program exists to support specific packages of work that benefit Rust. Project Grants will be awarded to both individuals and teams, whether you're a member of a Rust Project Team or Working Group or not. Additionally, Project Grants are available for non-coding education/outreach work.

Any work that benefits the Rust Project is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Ideally, the work will be carried out within six months of the grant being given.

Project grants are financial awards that support specific packages of work that benefit the Rust ecosystem. Any work that benefits the Rust ecosystem as a whole is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Applicants will choose from one of three categories of project focus: Maintenance and Support; Development and Infrastructure; and Community. The areas of work under each category are:

**Maintenance and Support**
* Code review
* Documentation updates
* Design review
* Issue triage
* Issue reporting
* Bug fixes

**Development and Infrastructure**
* New features and documentation
* Performance enhancements
* Rollups/CI/releases

**Community**
* Moderation
* Communication (e.g. writing blog posts, release notes, preparing for meetings or taking minutes)
* Producing education materials
* Providing educational support
* Supporting/mentoring/guiding other contributors
* Organizing Events / Meetups
* Coordination and management activities
* 
All grantees will be required to adhere to the [Rust Foundation’s Code of Conduct](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/), which is an extension of the [Rust Project Code of Conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct). Failure to adhere to the Code of Conduct may result in the grant being terminated.

## Who can apply?

Project Grants are open to applications from anyone who will be over the age of 18 at the time of the grant award. Rust Foundation staff, officers, and directors are not eligible to apply for any Rust Foundation grants. Employees of organizations that are Members of the Rust Foundation should contact us at grants@rustfoundation.org prior to completing an application, in order for us to assess whether an award to them might represent a conflict of interest for the Foundation.

You don’t have to speak English to apply for a Project Grant, but if your project involves interaction with members of the Rust Project Teams and Working Groups you will need a reasonable understanding of written English.

All Project Grant applicants must ensure that they are able to receive financial transfers from the USA. Details can be found [here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information) of the restrictions to such transactions.
