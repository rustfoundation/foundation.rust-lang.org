## About Rust Foundation Project Grants

The Rust Foundation Project Grants program exists to support specific packages of work that benefit Rust. Project Grants will be awarded to both individuals and teams, whether you're a member of a Rust Project Team or Working Group or not. Additionally, Project Grants are available for non-coding education/outreach work.

Any work that benefits the Rust Project is eligible for a Project Grant. Priority will be given to those grants that will clearly deliver a significant benefit to a reasonable proportion of the Rust community. Ideally, the work will be carried out within six months of the grant being given.

## *Additional Rules*

## &nbsp;

* *Rust Foundation staff, officers, and directors are not eligible to apply for any Rust Foundation grants.*

* *Employees of organizations that are members of the Rust Foundation who wish to apply as individuals or as part of a team should email us at [grants@rustfoundation.org](mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org) prior to completing an application, in order for us to assess whether a grant award might represent a conflict of interest for the Foundation.*

* \*The Rust Foundation is required to adhere to laws of the United States, and as a result all Project Grant applicants must be able to receive financial transfers from the USA. Details can be found [here](https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information) of the restrictions to such transactions. \*

* *If you have any questions about this, or would like more advice or help from the Foundation please email us at [grants@rustfoundation.org](mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org). We will do whatever we can to support you.*
