    <h1>Community Grants Program FAQs</h1>
</section>

<section class="container">

<h2 id="general">General FAQs</h2>

<h3>Why are you running a grants program and not simply supporting people directly through GitHub sponsorship?</h3>

<p>We need to be accountable to the organizations that have provided the funding for the grants program. This means that we need to enter into a formal agreement with each of our grantees, and we also need to be able, at the end of the grant year, to clearly demonstrate the impact of the funding program. Additionally, some projects will be best completed by teams or organizations, rather than individuals, and so we need to be able to fund these groups, and not just individuals.</p>

<h3>Who will be making the grant selection decisions?</h3>

<p>The Rust Foundation’s staff team, as detailed on the <a href="/grants-eligibility-and-selection/">Selection process page</a>.</p>

<h3>Will the corporations that fund Rust be making the grant selection decisions?</h3>

<p>No. Decisions will be made by the Rust Foundation’s staff team, as detailed on the <a href="/grants-eligibility-and-selection/">Selection process page</a>.</p>

<h3>Can I contact people involved in the grant selection decisions to talk more about my application?</h3>

<p>No. It is essential that the people involved in making the selection decisions can do so without any external interference, and we need to ensure that they are not overwhelmed by a lot of individuals contacting them to lobby for their application. For this reason it is important that your application is as comprehensive and compelling as possible. Any applicant who attempts to lobby someone involved in the grant selection process will automatically have their application rejected.</p>

<h3>Can I appeal the decision if my grant application is unsuccessful?</h3>

<p>No, all grant decisions will be final.</p>

<h3>Will I receive feedback on my application if it is unsuccessful?</h3>

<p>Yes, we hope to be able to give feedback to unsuccessful applicants in order to help them make successful applications in the future. This may take some time, depending on the volume of applications that we receive.</p>

<h2 id="fellowship">Rust Foundation Fellowship FAQs</h2>

<h3>When will the program start?</h3>

<p>July 2022.</p>

<h3>How long does the program last?</h3>

<p>12 months.</p>

<h3>Can I be a Fellow for more than one year?</h3>

<p>Right now, we only have funding for the first year of the Fellowship program, but we will be working to raise the funds to continue the program in future years.</p>

<h3>How will you choose the Fellows?</h3>

<p>Please see the <a href="/grants-eligibility-and-selection/">Selection process page</a>.</p>

<h3>Does it matter which country I live in or what my citizenship status is?</h3>

<p>No, but you have to be able to legally receive funds from the USA to be a Fellow.</p>

<h3>I am 17, can I apply to be a Rust Foundation Fellow?</h3>

<p>You have to be 18 or older on 1st June 2022. We need to be mindful of different countries’ child labor laws, and laws that mean people under the age of 18 can’t enter into legal contracts.</p>

<h3>I am not currently a member of a Rust Project Team or Working Group, can I apply?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>I don’t have any experience with Rust, can I apply?</h3>

<p>No, you have to have some experience with Rust to apply.</p>

<h3>How much time will I have to spend working on Rust for my Fellowship?</h3>

<p>We’d like Fellows to dedicate approximately 20 hours per month to the Rust project. We won’t require you to document the time spent, and will be flexible in allowing you to spend slightly more or less time in any given month. We want Fellows to achieve a healthy work/life balance and will actively encourage them to adopt reasonable working patterns.</p>

<h3>Because of my work/studies I can’t commit to dedicating 20 hours of time to Rust every month, is that going to be a problem?</h3>

<p>No, it won’t be a problem. We understand that the demands on people’s time vary over the course of a year, and will allow you to be flexible in allocating time to the Fellowship program. We do require you to spend on average 20 hours a month on the program over the course of the year.</p>

<h3>I currently dedicate a significant amount of time to Rust. If I become a Fellow, do I have to increase the number of hours I spend working on it?</h3>

<p>No. If you are already spending 20 or more hours a month working on the Rust project, then no additional hours are necessary. We encourage Fellows to limit the additional amount of time they spend working on the project to help achieve a healthy work-life balance.</p>

<h3>If I become a Rust Foundation Fellow will I automatically join one of the Project Teams?</h3>

<p>No, you don’t have to join a project team, but you can if you want. You can find out more about getting involved in the Rust Project Teams and Working Groups on the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance">rust-lang website</a>.</p>

<h3>I am interested in building the Rust community, not writing code, can I apply?</h3>

<p>Yes, though we do expect you to have experience of participating in the Rust community and have a clear idea of how your work will benefit it.</p>

<h3>I am currently paid to work on the Rust Project, can I apply?</h3>

<p>Yes, but people who are currently paid to work on the Rust Project full time will not be eligible. If you are only paid part-time to work on the Project, or not paid at all, you can apply.</p>

<h3>Do I have to speak English to be a Rust Foundation Fellow?</h3>

<p>You don’t have to speak English to be a Fellow, but you do need a reasonable understanding of written English in order to be able to interact with members of the Project Teams and Working Groups.</p>

<h3>How will the travel grants work?</h3>

<p>Fellows will let us know which Rust event they want to attend, and we will work with them to confirm the budget and then provide them with the funds needed to cover their attendance. Our travel budget is limited to $2,000 USD per Fellow and will provide economy travel, accommodation and subsistence, plus any conference ticket.</p>

<h3>What training support can I receive as a Fellow?</h3>

<p>We will work with each Fellow to understand what types of training would benefit them the most. We expect the training to include things like project planning, organizational management, leadership, document writing, and effective communication.</p>

<h3>Do I have to adhere to a Code of Conduct to be a Fellow?</h3>

<p>Yes, you have to adhere to the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Rust Foundation Code of Conduct</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Rust Project Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h3>Will I have to write reports on my work?</h3>

<p>Yes, you will have to write a brief report once every 3 months, and have a catch-up call with a member of the Rust Foundation staff team. At the end of your fellowship year you’ll be required to write a brief blog post about your experience, for publication on the Rust Foundation website.</p>

<h3>If I become a Fellow, will any information about me be published publicly?</h3>

<p>Yes, we will publish a brief biography on the Rust Foundation website, along with any public social media/other relevant links that you are willing to share. We can use your online alias and avatar instead of your legal name and photograph, if you prefer.</p>

<h3>How will I get paid as a Fellow?</h3>

<p>Either through GitHub Sponsorship or by direct bank transfer.</p>

<h3>Who will own the work that I produce as a Fellow?</h3>

<p>You will own the IP of any work that you create as a Fellow, but we will require you to release that work under an open source license so that the work can benefit the community as a whole.</p>

<h3>Can I drop out of the Fellowship before the year is up if I am not enjoying it?</h3>

<p>Yes, but it would be better if we can find ways to improve the program for you so that you do enjoy it! If Fellows have issues or concerns about the program, we want them to feel they can tell us about it, so that we can work together on finding a solution.</p>

<h3>Why are you running a Fellowship program rather than simply sponsoring people via GitHub?</h3>

<p>There are several reasons. We need to be accountable to the organizations that have provided the funding for the grants program. This means that we need to enter into a formal agreement with each of our grantees, and also be able, at the end of the grant year, to clearly demonstrate the impact of the funding program. We are keen to ensure that the Fellowship program provides more than just financial support – access to training and travel/conference opportunities. Finally, we want our Fellows to be (and feel) part of a group, who can share their knowledge and experience, and be ambassadors for Rust in the years to come.</p>

<h3>Can I share my Fellowship with someone else?</h3>

<p>No. Each Fellowship is for an individual person.</p>

<h3>How will you check on how I am spending my Fellowship time?</h3>

<p>We will be trusting our Fellows to honestly report how they have been supporting the Rust Project.</p>

<h3>Will you be able to help me understand the tax implications of receiving a Fellowship grant?</h3>

<p>The Foundation cannot provide advice on the personal tax arrangements or obligations of individual fellows. Individual Fellows are responsible for ensuring that they are complying with any tax laws that apply to the receipt of this funding in their country/jurisdiction of residence.</p>

<h3>I have got a question that hasn’t been answered here – how can I get in touch for more information?</h3>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> and we will do our best to help.</p>

<h3>I am interested in building the Rust community, not writing code, can I apply?</h3>

<p>Yes, though we do expect you/your organization to have experience of participating in the Rust community and have a clear idea of how your work will benefit it.</p>

<h3>Do I have to speak English to apply for a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>You don’t have to speak English, but if your project requires you to engage with other members of the Rust community (such as the Project Teams and Working Groups) then a reasonable understanding of written English will be necessary, to ensure that you can communicate effectively with them.</p>

<h3>Do people have to adhere to a Code of Conduct to be awarded a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>Yes, you have to adhere to the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Rust Foundation Code of Conduct</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Rust Project Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h3>Will I have to write reports on my work?</h3>

<p>Yes, you will have to write a brief report at the midpoint of your project, and have a catch-up call with a member of the Foundation’s staff. At the end of the project you’ll be required to write a brief final report, which may be published on the Foundation’s website.</p>

<h3>If I am awarded a Project Grant, will any information about me be published publicly?</h3>

<p>Yes, we will publish a brief biography of you / your team on the Rust Foundation website, along with any public social media/other relevant links that you are willing to share. We can use your online alias and avatar instead of your legal name and photograph, if you prefer. For organizations we will publish details of the organization and the project team leader.</p>

<h3>How will I get paid for my Project?</h3>

<p>Either by direct bank transfer or through GitHub Sponsorship.</p>

<h3>Who will own the work that I produce as a result of my Project?</h3>

<p>You will own the IP of any work that you create carrying out your Project, but we will require you to release that work under an open source license so that the work can benefit the community as a whole.</p>

<h3>What happens if I run into problems with my project or I realize that there is something better I could be doing?</h3>

<p>Please get in touch with the Foundation team! We completely understand that things don’t always go according to plan. We will be as flexible as possible and work with you to overcome any problems.</p>

<h3>How will you check on the progress of the Project Grants?</h3>

<p>We will require you to submit a brief report at the midpoint of your project, and have a catch-up call with a member of the Foundation’s staff.</p>

<h3>Will you be able to help me understand the tax implications of receiving a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>The Foundation cannot provide advice on grantees’ tax arrangements or obligations. You are responsible for ensuring that you are complying with any tax laws that apply to the receipt of the funding in your country. Organizational applicants should ensure that any sales tax (if applicable) is taken into account in the calculation of their project budget.</p>

<h3>Why are grants only available up to $20k?</h3>

<p>We have a relatively limited budget for Project Grants. We would prefer to use this to support a larger number of projects from a diverse range of individuals and organizations that will benefit Rust in many different ways – not just make a small handful of large grant awards.</p>

<h3>My project will cost more than $20k. Can I apply for $20k from Rust Foundation, and find the rest of the money elsewhere?</h3>

<p>Yes, but you will need to provide details of how much additional funding you need, and where you’re seeking this funding from. We will only release our portion of the funds for your project when you are able to confirm that you have firm commitments for the rest of the funding.</p>

<h3>Am I more likely to get my project funded if it is of a comparatively low value?</h3>

<p>No, the most important factor in your project getting funded is the benefit it will provide for the Rust community. Making sure that your application clearly demonstrates this will help with your application’s chance of success.</p>

<h3>Do I need to provide a budget/breakdown of costs?</h3>

<p>Yes, you will need to provide a budget/breakdown of your project costs. E.g. X hours of time at $Y per hour, Z additional service costs etc.</p>

<h3>Will I need to provide receipts?</h3>

<p>No, but we will ask you to maintain records of your expenditure, in case the Foundation requires them in the future for audit purposes.</p>

<h3>Why are you allowing for-profit organizations to apply for Project Grants?</h3>

<p>We expect that the majority of our grants will be made to individuals or teams of individuals. However, we know that for-profit organizations can provide significant benefits for Rust, if given the opportunity to do so. Organizations that are Members of the Rust Foundation, though, are not eligible to apply for Project Grants due to potential conflicts of interest.</p>

<h3>I have got a question that hasn’t been answered here – how can I get in touch for more information?</h3>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> and we will do our best to help.</p>
