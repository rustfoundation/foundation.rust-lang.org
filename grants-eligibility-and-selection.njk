</section>

<section class="container">

<h2 id="eligibility-criteria">Eligibility Criteria</h2>

<p>All grant applicants must be over the age of 18 by the date of the grant award.</p>

<p>All grant applicants must ensure that they are able to receive financial transfers from the USA.  Details can be found <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/financial-sanctions/sanctions-programs-and-country-information">here</a> of the restrictions to such transactions.</p>

<p>Individuals whose past behavior(s) would have been in breach of the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Rust Foundation Code of Conduct</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Rust Project Code of Conduct</a>, will not be eligible for grant funding.</p>

<p>Applications to the Rust Foundation Fellowships and Project Grants can only be made in English, as successful applicants will need to engage with Project Teams and/or Working Groups for whom English is the primary language of technical communication.

<h2 id="exclusion-criteria">Exclusion Criteria</h2>

<p>Applicants who have no experience of Rust, or who are proposing work that is of trivial (or no) value to the Rust community, will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p>Applicants who attempt to lobby decision-makers involved in the grants selection process will be automatically rejected.</p>

<p>Applicants for Project Grants or Fellowships who are already paid to work on the Rust Project full-time will be automatically rejected (part-time is fine).</p>

<p>Prospective applicants for Fellowships or Project Grants who work for one of the Rust Foundation’s Member organizations should contact us at <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> prior to completing an application, in order for us to assess whether a grant award to them might represent a conflict of interest for the Foundation.</p>

<p>Rust Foundation staff, officers, and directors are not eligible to apply for any Rust Foundation grants. In addition, organizations that are Members of the Rust Foundation are not eligible to apply for Project Grants.</p>

<h2 id="fellowships-and-projects">Fellowships and Project Grants Selection Process</h2>

<h3>Scoring and Approval</h3>

<p>Scoring will be carried out by the Rust Foundation staff team (as a single group) for a total possible score of 15.  To ensure that we are only funding high-quality applicants, a minimum threshold score of 10 is required for an applicant to be considered for an award.  Where necessary, the staff team will reach out to members of an advisory board for insight into specific applications (the advisory board will be appointed in April 2022 once we have a better understanding of the types of specialist advice we are likely to need, and details of the advisory board members will be published on the Rust Foundation website in May 2022).</p>

<p>Selections for funding will be based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Overall application score.</li>
<li>The nature of other applications. We want our funding to be distributed widely across the community, not to be focused on a single area of the project.</li>
<li>The capacity of project teams to engage with the fellows/projects.  We don’t want to overload any project team.</li>
</ul>

<p>The funding decisions made by the Foundation staff team will be presented to the Rust Foundation Board of Directors for approval in May 2022.</p>

<h3>Selection Criteria — Rust Foundation Fellowships (Full Fellows)</h3>

<p>Each application will be scored against three categories of criteria.  Scores will be given in the range of 1-5 for each set, with the scores being aggregated for a total possible maximum score of 15.</p>

<h4>Need, Diversity, and Engagement</h4>

<p>We want our grants program to include and represent the diversity of our community, and we want to ensure that our financial resources are directed towards those most in need of them. We are also keen to reflect and support the increasingly globally diverse nature of the Rust Community by helping those community members in countries with lower levels of engagement in the Rust Community to take a more active role.</p>

<h2 id="events">Event Support Grants Selection Process</h2>

<p>Event Support Grant applications will be reviewed and selected by the Rust Foundation staff team.  It is hoped that in the majority of cases the response will be positive.  Event Support Grants will not be subject to the 15-point scoring system used for Project Grants and Fellowships. Instead, there will be a lighter-touch process, reflecting the relatively low amounts being awarded under this program. The staff team will make their decision based on:</p>

<ul>
<li>The type of event being proposed</li>
<li>The number of people likely to benefit from the event</li>
<li>The amount of funding being sought</li>
<li>The accessibility of the event</li>
<li>The experience of the individual/team running the event</li>
<li>The location/languages of the event</li>
</ul>

<p>We will aim to make a decision regarding an Event Support Grant within 10 working days of receiving an application.</p>

<h2 id="hardship">Hardship Grants Selection Process</h2>

<p>Hardship Grant applications will be reviewed and selected by the Rust Foundation staff team.  By exception, we might reach out to Rust Foundation Directors or members of the Project Teams for their advice. But given the sensitive nature of the circumstances under which someone might apply for a Hardship Grant we are keen to keep details of any applications as private as possible. The decisions will be made based upon:</p>

<ul>
<li>The contributions made by the individual to the Rust Project</li>
<li>The individual’s financial circumstances and need</li>
</ul>

<p>We will aim to make a decision regarding a Hardship Grant within 5 working days of receiving an application.</p>
