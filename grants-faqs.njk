<h2 id="general">General FAQs</h2>

<h3>Why are you running a grants program and not simply supporting people directly through GitHub sponsorship?</h3>

<p>We need to be accountable to the organizations that have provided the funding for the grants program. This means that we need to enter into a formal agreement with each of our grantees, and we also need to be able, at the end of the grant year, to clearly demonstrate the impact of the funding program. Additionally, some projects will be best completed by teamwork, and so we need to be able to fund groups or organizations, and not just individuals.</p>

<h3>Who will be making the grant selection decisions?</h3>

<p>The Rust Foundation’s staff team, as detailed on the <a href="/grants-eligibility-and-selection/">Selection process page</a>.</p>

<h3>Will the corporations that fund Rust be making the grant selection decisions?</h3>

<p>No. Decisions will be made by the Rust Foundation’s staff team, as detailed on the <a href="/grants-eligibility-and-selection/">Selection process page</a>.</p>

<h3>Can I contact Rust Foundation Board members to talk more about my application?</h3>

<p>No. It is essential that the people involved in making the selection decisions can do so without any external interference, and we need to ensure that they are not overwhelmed by a lot of individuals contacting them to lobby for their application. For this reason it is important that your application is as comprehensive and compelling as possible. Any applicant who attempts to lobby one of the Rust Foundation Board members will automatically have their application rejected.</p>

<h3>Can I appeal the decision if my grant application is unsuccessful?</h3>

<p>No, all grant decisions will be final.</p>

<h3>Will I receive feedback on my application if it is unsuccessful?</h3>

<p>Yes, we hope to be able to give feedback to unsuccessful applicants in order to help them make successful applications in the future. This may take some time, depending on the volume of applications that we receive.</p>

<h2 id="project-grants">Rust Project Grants FAQs</h2>

<h3>Can teams of people work together on a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>Yes, we welcome applications from teams of individuals. If you are interested in applying as an organization, please contact us to discuss.</p>

<h3>How will you choose the Project Grants?</h3>

<p>Please see the <a href="/grants-eligibility-and-selection/">Selection process page</a>.</p>

<h3>Does it matter which country I live in or what my citizenship status is?</h3>

<p>No, but you must be able to legally receive funds from the USA to receive a Project Grant.</p>

<h3>I am 17, can I apply for a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>You have to be 18 or older on the date your project will start. We need to be mindful of different countries’ child labor laws, and laws that mean people under the age of 18 can’t enter into legal contracts.</p>

<h3>I am not currently a member of a Rust Project Team or Working Group, can I apply for a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>Yes.</p>

<h3>I don’t have any experience with Rust, can I apply?</h3>

<p>No, you’ll need to have some experience with Rust to apply (but that doesn’t necessarily mean coding experience, if you’re applying in the Community focus area).</p>

<h3>If I am awarded a Project Grant will I automatically join one of the Project Teams?</h3>

<p>No, you don’t have to join a project team, but you can if you want. You can find out more about getting involved in the Rust Project Teams and Working Groups on the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/governance">rust-lang website</a>.</p>

<h3>I am interested in building the Rust community, not writing code, can I apply?</h3>

<p>Yes, though we do expect you to have experience of participating in the Rust community and have a clear idea of how your work will benefit it.</p>

<h3>Do I have to speak English to apply for a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>You don’t have to speak English, but if your project requires you to engage with other members of the Rust community (such as the Project Teams and Working Groups) then a reasonable understanding of written English will be necessary, to ensure that you can communicate effectively with them.</p>

<h3>Do people have to adhere to a Code of Conduct to be awarded a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>Yes, you have to adhere to the <a href="https://foundation.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct/">Rust Foundation Code of Conduct</a>, which is an extension of the <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct">Rust Project Code of Conduct</a>.</p>

<h3>Will I have to write reports on my work?</h3>

<p>Yes, you will have to write a brief report at the midpoint of your project, and have a catch-up call with a member of the Foundation’s staff. At the end of the project you’ll be required to write a brief final report, which may be published on the Foundation’s website.</p>

<h3>If I am awarded a Project Grant, will any information about me be published publicly?</h3>

<p>Yes, we will publish a brief biography of you / your team on the Rust Foundation website, along with any public social media/other relevant links that you are willing to share. We can use your online alias and avatar instead of your legal name and photograph, if you prefer.</p>

<h3>How will I get paid for my Project?</h3>

<p>Either by direct bank transfer or through GitHub Sponsorship.</p>

<h3>Who will own the work that I produce as a result of my Project?</h3>

<p>You will own the IP of any work that you create carrying out your Project, but we will require you to release that work under an open source license so that the work can benefit the community as a whole.</p>

<h3>What happens if I run into problems with my project or I realize that there is something better I could be doing?</h3>

<p>Please get in touch with the Foundation team! We completely understand that things don’t always go according to plan. We will be as flexible as possible and work with you to overcome any problems.</p>

<h3>How will you check on the progress of the Project Grants?</h3>

<p>We will require you to submit a brief report at the midpoint of your project, and have a catch-up call with a member of the Foundation’s staff.</p>

<h3>Will you be able to help me understand the tax implications of receiving a Project Grant?</h3>

<p>The Foundation cannot provide advice on grantees’ tax arrangements or obligations. You are responsible for ensuring that you are complying with any tax laws that apply to the receipt of the funding in your country.</p>

<h3>Why are grants only available up to $15k?</h3>

<p>We have a relatively limited budget for Project Grants. We would prefer to use this to support a larger number of projects from a diverse range of applicants that will benefit Rust in many different ways – not just make a small handful of large grant awards.</p>

<h3>My project will cost more than $15k. Can I apply for $15k from Rust Foundation, and find the rest of the money elsewhere?</h3>

<p>Yes, but you will need to provide details of how much additional funding you need, and where you’re seeking this funding from. We will only release our portion of the funds for your project when you are able to confirm that you have firm commitments for the rest of the funding.</p>

<h3>Am I more likely to get my project funded if it is of a comparatively low value?</h3>

<p>No, the most important factor in your project getting funded is the benefit it will provide for the Rust community. Making sure that your application clearly demonstrates this will help with your application’s chance of success.</p>

<h3>Do I need to provide a budget/breakdown of costs?</h3>

<p>We realise that at the application stage it can be difficult to estimate just how much time and money a project will likely cost. If you are unsure then we are happy to work with you directly to come up with a budget for your project.</p>

<h3>Will I need to provide receipts?</h3>

<p>No, but we will ask you to maintain records of your expenditure, in case the Foundation requires them in the future for audit purposes.</p>

<h3>I have got a question that hasn’t been answered here – how can I get in touch for more information?</h3>

<p>Please email <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> and we will do our best to help.</p>
