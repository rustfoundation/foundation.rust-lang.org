    <h1>Interested in Rust Foundation Support or Sponsorship For Your Event?</h1>
    <p>The Rust Foundationâ€™s stewardship of the Rust programming language and ecosystem includes promoting, contributing, and championing events hosted by Rust community members. Our goal is to support a variety of Rust-focused events around the world.<     <p>Whether your Rust-focused gathering is a newer/smaller meetup or a larger/more established event, please review the process for receiving support or sponsorship below.</p></div></section>

    <h2>What We Look For in Event Support/Sponsorship Requests</h2>
    <p>Because the Rust Foundation receives many requests for sponsorship and financial support across a wide range of focus areas, we generally evaluate event sponsorship inquiries using the following considerations:</p>
    <h3>Impact</h3>
    <p>We are more likely to consider sponsoring events that cater to different types of attendees (for example: both students and professionals using Rust) from across the world. We will consider issuing a smaller grant for smaller and more focused gatherings.</p>
    <h3>Reach</h3>
    <p>The Rust Foundation bases its support/sponsorship decisions on the stated goals of your event. We look for clear alignment between your goals and our mission to steward the Rust programming language and support its global community. If we feel your event is specifically aimed at filling a gap in the Rust ecosystem, we are more likely to serve as a sponsor. For example, we are more likely to sponsor an event that aims to help new Rust job-seekers network than we are to sponsor an event for general Rust enthusiasts. We are more likely to issue an Event Support Grant if your gathering is more general in nature.</p>
    <h3>Audience Diversity</h3>
    <p>The Rust Foundation is always more likely to sponsor events that anticipate a diverse and inclusive global audience with data to demonstrate this. If your smaller gathering is more focused around a specific city, we are more likely to consider issuing an Event Support Gratn.</p>
    <h3>Organizational Capacity</h3>
    <p>Given the many complexities associated with planning events, we are more likely to sponsor an event if the organizing team has demonstrable experience hosting events/meetups for the open source community. There are exceptions to this expectation.</p>
    <h3>Region</h3>
    <p>Given the recent proliferation of Rust events all around the world, the Rust Foundation must balance our sponsorship across as many geographic regions as possible. We are much more likely to sponsor your event if it is one of the only Rust-focused events in your area. We are more likely to consider the grant model if your gathering is one of many in your area.</p>
    <h3>Audience Size</h3>
    <p>Knowing how many attendees you are anticipating will allow us to better allocate funding for sponsorship. If you are projecting fewer than 100 attendees, we will likely consider your inquiry a request for an Event Support Grant.</p>
    <h3>Nonprofit vs. Commercial Model</h3>
    <p>The Rust Foundation is much more likely to sponsor and support non-commercial, not-for-profit events.</p>

  <h2>About Event Support Grants </h2>
  <p> Rust Event Support Grants exist to support Rust-related events, both in-person and virtual, through awards ranging from $100-$500. These grants help provide financial support for individuals, groups, and organizations to help cover the costs they incur in running non-profit-making events that support the Rust community. Event Support Grants are intended to cover typical event expenses like space rental fees, travel costs, refreshments, swag, online event platform costs, etc.</p></div></section>
