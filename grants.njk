<p><center><h2>Guiding Principles</h2></center></p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="subheader">
<i><h3>The design and implementation of the grants program has been guided by the following standards:</h3></i>
</div>
<div class="INDEPENDENCE">
<u><p style="display: inline;">INDEPENDENCE:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">The Community Grants Program must operate, and be clearly seen to operate, independently of the member organizations of the Foundation and any corporate interests.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="fairness">
<u><p style="display: inline;">FAIRNESS:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">Rust Foundation grants must be awarded fairly, without bias or prejudice, and actively seek to represent the diversity of the global Rust community.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="transparency">
<u><p style="display: inline;">TRANSPARENCY:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">The grant awarding processes must be clearly described both to the applicants themselves and to the community as a whole.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="responsiveness">
<u><p style="display: inline;">RESPONSIVENESS:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">The Rust Foundation must be receptive and responsive to feedback and criticism about the operation of the Community Grants Program. Such feedback should be used to iterate future grant programs.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="lightness of touch">
<u><p style="display: inline;">LIGHTNESS OF TOUCH:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">The application processes and monitoring and evaluation processes should not be overly onerous for the applicants and successful grantees.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="trust">
<u><p style="display: inline;">TRUST:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">The Rust Foundation must fundamentally trust that its grantees are committed to Rust and not burden them with officious oversight.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="impact">
<u><p style="display: inline;">IMPACT:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">Rust Foundation grants should aim to be as impactful as possible in their support of Rust.</p>
</div>
<br>
<div class="flexibility">
<u><p style="display: inline;">FLEXIBILITY:</p></u>
<p style="display: inline;">The Rust Foundation must be prepared to change its expectations of the outcomes of a grant should the personal circumstances of our grantees change.</p>

  <details>
  <summary>Who makes the grant selection decisions?</summary>
  <h3>The Rust Foundation’s staff team is responsible for selecting all grant recipients, however we occasionally seek input from leaders within the Rust Project and Rust Foundation Member Directors on specific applications.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>What is the Rust Project’s involvement in the Community Grants Program?</summary>
  <h3>In developing the Community Grants Program, the Rust Foundation’s staff team consulted with the Rust Foundation Project Directors (representatives for the Rust Project that serve on our board of directors) and grantee mentors from within the Rust Project. While the Foundation makes the ultimate decisions about grants to award, we seek input from leaders within the Rust Project.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will the corporate members that fund the Rust Foundation be making the grant selection decisions?</summary>
  <h3>No. While we occasionally consult with specific Rust Foundation Member Directors when they can help us better assess an individual applicant’s candidacy, all final decisions about grants to award are made by the Rust Foundation’s staff team.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I contact Rust Foundation Board members to talk more about my application?</summary>
  <h3>No. It is essential that the people involved in making the selection decisions can do so without any external interference, and we need to ensure that they are not overwhelmed by a lot of individuals contacting them to lobby for their application. For this reason it is important that your application is as comprehensive and compelling as possible. Any applicant who attempts to lobby one of the Rust Foundation Board members will automatically have their application rejected.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can I appeal the decision if my grant application is unsuccessful?</summary>
  <h3>No, all grant decisions will be final.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Will I receive feedback on my application if it is unsuccessful?</summary>
  <h3>Yes, we hope to be able to give feedback to unsuccessful applicants in order to help them make successful applications in the future. This may take some time, depending on the volume of applications that we receive.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>Can you help me understand the tax implications of receiving a grant?</summary>
  <h3>Individual grantees are responsible for ensuring that they are complying with any tax laws that apply to the receipt of this funding in their country/jurisdiction of residence. The Rust Foundation cannot provide advice on the personal tax arrangements or obligations of individual grantees.</h3>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>I have a question that hasn’t been answered here. How can I get in touch for more information?</summary>
  <h3>Please email <a href="mailto:grants@rustfoundation.org">grants@rustfoundation.org</a> and we will do our best to help.</h3>
